List of things I did for updating to a new mc version.
The list might not be exhaustive or correctly ordered yet, adapt in the future.

backup project folder
go into build.gradle and under dependencies change the forge version to a respective new version
get the mdk from the forge download page for the new forge version and compare the build.gradle -> update the changes in your build.gradle
run gradlew genEclipseRuns and gradlew eclipse
update src/main/resources/pack.mcmeta and src/main/resources/mods.toml
refresh gradle project
