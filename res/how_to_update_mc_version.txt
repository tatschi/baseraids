List of things I did for updating to a new mc version.
The list might not be exhaustive, correctly ordered  or too verbose -> adapt in the future.

- create new branch in repo
- clone repo with new branch
- create new workspace in eclipse
- download the mdk from the forge download page for the new forge version and compare the build.gradle
then update the changes in your build.gradle, most important change the forge version
- copy folder "eclipse_project/gradle" from old to new branch
- run gradlew genEclipseRuns and gradlew eclipse
- update the src/main/resources/pack.mcmeta from the respective forge mdk folder
- update the version in src/main/resources/mods.toml
- import gradle project into eclipse workspace
- if neccessary, download and install java jdk for new java version
then add and set the jdk in eclipse project properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries
