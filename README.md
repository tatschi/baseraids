# baseraids
This mod adds monster raids on your base that will destroy parts of your base or earn you valuable goods.

It adds a nexus block that will be the heart of your base and the attacks target. You must have a nexus block in your base. If the nexus is destroyed, you lose the raid. If you can kill all attackers or the nexus survives for long enough, you earn a reward!
The raids have multiple levels(15?) of increasing difficulty and reward. Defending off a raid will increase the next raid level, however, if you lose a raid, the level will be reset to 1.

After you have defended the highest raid level, you will be able to avoid raids.
Raids are intended to occur every couple of days, but there will be a the possibility to change this setting.

The mod also removes monster spawning at night (but not in caves).

Raise your defense, secure your base and nexus, fight! The raids are coming.
